# ChatApp

This is a little sandbox experiment that I'm using to learn more about Phoenix, Channels, LiveView, and PubSub. The crux of the idea is having a browser-based chat application implemented with LiveView, while also allowing any external client to join a chat room. So far it only works with the official Phoenix JS client. You can read about my lessons learned on my blog [here](https://shaka-n.github.io/).

To start thePhoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
